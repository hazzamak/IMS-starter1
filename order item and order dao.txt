add item to order using order_item table - create function
order_id foreign collum

orderitem.dao.create - just method to insert rows into table
how and where to give access?
=
one order controller that has access to two DAOs

customer controller, input from user for customer, uses customerDAO
item controller, input for items, uses itemDAO
order controller, two DAOs, orderDAO + orderItemDAO, create read delete
uses orderitemdao to create + delete, uses orderID 
single order controller, both DAOs
only uses orderitem to add and delete orders

easiest is one ordercontroller two DAOs
within ordercontroller is ALL function, view add delete etc
